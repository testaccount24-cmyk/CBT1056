 Using RUNDATA for site-by-site customization of REXX code:


 Many routines available for download by the wider user community are
 -- no surprise -- written originally to operate at the originating
 location, and are expected to be customized to local standards after
 download and before they are made generally available at a remote
 site.

 The present custom is that when a new version of software is
 downloaded from an originating site, customization done on the
 now-obsolete version to make it operate correctly at that site must
 be replicated on the newly-downloaded routine.

 RUNDATA is an excellent vehicle for use as an 'automatic customizer'.

 The datapoints requiring modification site-by-site can be specified
 as part of a RUNDATA table row.  At a remote site, an installer
 specifies the values for the individual datapoints required at that
 site -- once.  If the routine to be customized gets its data from the
 local site-specific RUNDATA table, a fresh download will pull in
 (from the RUNDATA table) the historical datapoints applicable to the
 remote site and all is well.

 The RUNDATA table doesn't change from version to version save only
 for newly-implemented datapoints being added to the latest version.
 In that case, installation instructions merely have to note the
 nature of the modification needed to the local RUNDATA table:
     "Note that tag OUTDS should be added to the RUNDATA table for key
      TENSOR and specify the fully-qualified unquoted dataset name to
      receive the diagnostic report.  The dataset name specified will
      be created or overwritten as needed.  Example:

      %RUNDATA WRITE TBLKEY tensor SAFE DATA(outds:<local dsname>;)

      See the HELP-text for RUNDATA for more information."

 To rig a REXX routine to utilize RUNDATA for this purpose, the
 following method may be used:

     address TSO
     "NEWSTACK"
     "RUNDATA READ TBLKEY zork "       /* sets ASMVER PLIVER COBVER  */
     do queued()
        pull tag tagval                /* may be multiple            */
        tagval = Strip( tagval )
        @z     = Value( tag,tagval )   /* tag <-- tagval             */
     end                               /* queued                     */
     "DELSTACK"

 This example presupposes that the RUNDATA table has a key of 'zork'
 and that one or more extension variables are attached to this row.
 Each such extension variable has a value that, when substituted
 within the REXX routine, permits the code to operate as expected.
